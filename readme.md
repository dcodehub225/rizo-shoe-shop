## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements and Code Enhancements

- **Global Exception Handling**: Centralized using `@ControllerAdvice` (GlobalExceptionHandler) with custom exceptions like `ResourceNotFoundException`, `BadRequestException` for consistent error responses.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Implemented across service and controller layers for operation tracking and debugging.
- **CORS Configuration**: Enabled via Spring Security to allow communication between front-end and back-end across origins.
- **Server-side Validation**: Done via `jakarta.validation` annotations in DTOs.
- **Model Mapping**: Handled using `ModelMapper`, with custom config and `@EntityGraph` to avoid `LazyInitializationException` for lazy-loaded relationships.
